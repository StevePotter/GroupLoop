# GroupLoop.com: a Yammer-like social network created in 2000

Please note: I no longer own GroupLoop.com and am not affiliated with anything there now.  I looked on 2/10/2017 and have no idea what it is. 

In 1999, I was in college and doing web sites as a summer job.  I started doing interactive "data-driven" sites in php, perl, then Active Server Pages.  I enjoyed ASP, which is not ASP.NET by the way, and stuck with it.

I made a site for my high school buddies, who were scattered around the country, to write stories, share photos, etc.  This is before MySpace, Facebook, but after the initial dot-com bubble on late 90's.  At this point nobody wanted anything to do with web sites.

Other people saw that site and asked if I could make one for them.  It was then I realized my calling was to create a service that supplied private web sites for groups.  I used all the money I had made building web sites for local businesses and spent thousands of hours building the code and business of GroupLoop.

Eventually the inability to group the business wore on me.  I couldn't raise money and my dream was slipping away.  In 2005 I closed GroupLoop, eventually even forgetting to renew the domain.

I've been meaning to write the full story but my time is limited.  I recently stumbled on the source code and decided at the very least I can post it up.

I wrote this when I was 19, when there was no stackoverflow and when Google had just come out.  Pages were laid out with tables.  IE6 hadn't even come out yet.

Don't try to get this code working.  Or try and let me know how far you get.  Thanks!
