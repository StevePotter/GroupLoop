<p align=left class=BodyText><span class=Heading><%=intChapter%>.1 WHAT'S A MEMBER?: </span>&nbsp;
Visitors to your site can be divided into two distinct categories: Non-members and Members.  The first is non-members.  
This group has very limited capabilities on your site.  Non-members can only view public information and participate in 
public sections such as the message board, the guestbook, voting polls, and quizzes.  Don't discount them 
yet, though.  The majority of our longest running sites may have hundreds (in a few cases thousands) 
of non-members that visit on a regular basis.  Often times, a non-member who is a regular visitor to one 
particular GroupLoop site, has a membership with his own GroupLoop site.  An administrator could, however, make your site 
completely private, never allowing non-members to read or write anything on your site.

	<p align=left class=BodyText>
	<%PrintBullet%><span class=SubHeading>Member Properties - </span>
	Every membership has six data fields that are originally created by the administrator but can be changed 
	later by the member or the administrator (except admin access; only the administrator can change that).
	<blockquote>
		<p align=left class=BodyText>
		<b><i>1 - First Name:</i></b>  
		This is the legal first name of the site member.
		<br>
		<b><i>2 - Last Name:</i></b>  
		This is the legal last name of the site member.
		<br>
		<b><i>3 - Nickname:</i></b>  
		The nickname is the label that will be displayed as author on a member's posts.  It's also the screen 
		name that your member will need to sign in to the members section.  Most members and/or administrators 
		choose nicknames that they commonly hear from the other members.  For instance, your group of friends 
		might call Robert just Bob for short.  This field is not case-sensitive meaning whether you use capital 
		letters or lower-case ones makes no difference (A is equal to a).
		<br>
		<b><i>4 - Password:</i></b>  
		This is the series of letters and/or numbers that must be entered after the nickname in the 
		log-in page.  It's a good idea for the member to use a password that isn't too obvious to others, 
		but one that he/she still won't forget.  This field is also not case-sensitive.
		<br>
		<b><i>5 - Email Address:</i></b>  
		An entry in this field, though not required, is strongly recommended.  If other members or guests 
		wish to contact the author of a particular post, his/her email can be easily accessed.  Also, the 
		email notification feature requires a valid email address.  When adding a new member, selecting email 
		notification will automatically inform the new member of his/her new privileges at your site.

<p align=left class=BodyText><span class=Heading><%=intChapter%>.2 YOUR INFORMATION: </span>&nbsp;
In addition to the six fields above, you also can enter in two addresses, phone number, cell number, etc.  These 
are optional, but remember non-members can't view it.  However, you can make certain information public.
</p>

	<p align=left class=BodyText>
	<%PrintBullet%><span class=SubHeading>Changing Your Personal Info - </span>
	To change your information:

	<blockquote>

		<p align=left class=BodyText>
		<b><i>1 <%PrintSymb "Member", ""%>:</i></b>  
		Click Change Your Info under the Members subheading.
		<br>
		<b><i>2 <%PrintSymb "Edit", "edit info.gif"%>:</i></b>  
		Make the necessary changes.<br>
		<blockquote>
			<%PrintArrow%><b><i>Public Info:</i></b> 
			Above your name, e-mails, and other information, the option to make it public is there.  If you do make it 
			public, when anyone clicks on your name anywhere on the site, your public information will be shown.  So 
			be careful, but if you don't care, make it public!  We strongly recommend putting in your home address, etc.  
			Members will be able to view your information, making the site a good reference for contacting someone.
		</blockquote>

		<b><i>3:</i></b>  
		Scroll to the bottom of the page and click the Update button.
