<p align=left class=BodyText><span class=Heading><%=intChapter%>.1 BEING THE ADMINISTRATOR: </span>&nbsp;
As the administrator of your site, you have capabilities that can be accessed only by you 
and are not available to guests or even site members.  You are able to manipulate the site 
in any manner you like.
</p>

	<p align=left class=BodyText>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	Although the size of this manual may seem intimidating, don't worry.  Your site was ready to 
	go the minute you signed up for the GroupLoop service.  You don't have to be a computer 
	wizard to get a fully functional site up and running.  In addition, you don't have to worry 
	about making mistakes. All of your administrator options are always available, so feel free 
	to experiment. You can always go back and change things to your liking.  As you learn more 
	about your interactive community, you will find yourself referring back to this manual to 
	seek out solutions to specific tasks.   
	</p>

	<p align=left class=BodyText>
	<b>Note:</b> When you signed up for the GroupLoop service, not only were you made the 
	administrator of your site, but you were also added as the first member.  It's a good 
	idea to read the Member's Manual first to get an idea of what the site is all about.  
	It describes the section areas and their uses.  Once you get a feel for moving around as a 
	member, you'll want to come back to this manual and take on your role as administrator.

<p align=left class=BodyText><span class=Heading><%=intChapter%>.2 THE ADMINISTRATOR'S CAPABILITIES: </span>&nbsp;
In the following chapters, each administrator option is explained.  All of your options can be 
grouped into four categories: <b><i>customization</i></b> of the site, <b><i>editing</i></b> of member and guest input, 
<b><i>categorization</i></b> of archives, and <b><i>addition</i></b> of conversational pieces:
</p>

	<blockquote>

		<p align=left class=BodyText>
		<b><i>Customization:</i></b> Customization is the most involved category of your capabilities. The administrator 
		has an enormous amount of customizational capabilities.  You're able to customize your site's 
		visual properties, section features, member roster, and so much more.
		</p>

		<p align=left class=BodyText>
		<b><i>Editing:</i></b> Editing is a pretty straightforward set of capabilities.  Sometimes, you will find it 
		necessary to alter or completely remove a member or guest's addition to the site.  These tools 
		are available to you in case you wish to remove inappropriate content, correct inaccuracies, or 
		just plain wield your administrative powers.  Anything that goes onto the site can be altered or 
		deleted by the administrator, so you are the final say on what stays up.
		</p>

		<p align=left class=BodyText>
		<b><i>Categorization:</i></b> Categorization is a grouping of organizational capabilities.  
		You will find that the majority of your sit's input will come in the form of photo and message 
		forum files.  Therefore, categorization features simply allow you to change the categories where 
		specific message board posts or photo files are located.  For instance, you may want to group your 
		photos into <i>College Pals</i>, <i>Sports Pics</i>, <i>Family</i>, and <i>Trips</i>.  You're also able to add new categories 
		and reorganize files within these categories whenever you like.
		</p>

		<p align=left class=BodyText>
		<b><i>Addition:</i></b> Addition of conversational pieces is the fun part of being the 
		administrator. This set of capabilities lets you: post news updates concerning the sites newest 
		additions, add photos, poll your audience, and create quizzes for members and guests.
		</p>

	<p align=left class=BodyText>
	<b>Note:</b> It will most likely some time getting used to the site until you 
	will actually find a need for all of the administrator options afforded you.  In <a href="#"><b>Chapter 2</b></a>, 
	there is a short Administrator's Tutorial that gives just some basic examples of your options.
	</p>

<a name="3"></a>
<p align=left class=BodyText><span class=Heading><%=intChapter%>.3 THIS MANUAL: </span>&nbsp;
In this manual, we do our best to ease you into your role as site administrator.  Like we said 
before, it's a great idea to read the Member's Manual first, as it will answer a lot of your 
basic questions about your new interactive community.
</p>

	<p align=left class=BodyText>
	<%PrintBullet%><span class=SubHeading>The Layout - </span>
	Each chapter of the Administrator's Manual focuses on a specific section(s) of your site.  The 
	chapter's first subchapter (designated by a decimal and all caps) typically explains your 
	responsibilities for that particular site section. 
	</p>

	<p align=left class=BodyText>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	Each additional subchapter usually consists of either definitions and/or several procedures.  
	The definitions describe features to be used in the upcoming procedures.  Each procedure is a 
	numbered listing of steps and diagrams that instruct the administrator on how to complete a 
	specific administrator task.
	</p>

	<p align=left class=BodyText>
	<b>Note:</b> There are often breaks between steps (signified by <%PrintArrow%>).  These procedure 
	breaks are used when a step has multiple options, each needing its own explanation.
	</p>

	<p align=left class=BodyText>
	<%PrintBullet%><span class=SubHeading>Page Types - </span>
	Each step of a procedure consists of first, completing a task on one webpage and then, loading a 
	new page for the next step (unless otherwise specified).  Since your site has the possibility of 
	having an infinite number of individual webpages, we have decided not to label each one separately 
	in this manual.  Instead, we have grouped all of your pages into types.
	</p>

	<p align=left class=BodyText>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	At the start of each step there is a symbol referring to the specific page type where that step begins.  
	If you click on the page symbol, this manual will automatically direct you to a diagram depicting the actual 
	page where that step takes place.  There are ten page types all with their own corresponding symbols:
	</p>

	<blockquote>

		<p align=left class=BodyText>
		<b><i>Addition:</i></b> 
		When you direct your web browser to your new site, the home page is the first webpage you will see.  There 
		is only one home page and it will be far and away your most commonly visited page.  Your home page will have 
		your site title, links to all your section areas, news updates, and a listing of the site's most recent member 
		and guest additions.  Within a procedure, the home page is symbolized by <%PrintSymb "Home", ""%>.  (The home page 
		is described in much greater detail in the Member's Manual.  PLEASE READ THAT FIRST).
		</p>

		<p align=left class=BodyText>
		<b><i>The Main Member Page:</i></b> 
		This page can only be accessed by site members because it requires a sign-in process.  The main member page 
		has a list of options called the member menu.  This is also where administrators will have their special options 
		not available to members.  These additional options are what make up the Administrator 
		Manual.  The main member page is symbolized by <%PrintSymb "Member", ""%>.
		</p>

		<p align=left class=BodyText>
		<b><i>Viewing Pages:</i></b> 
		A viewing page is just that: a page for viewing a particular member or guest post.  Every single item on your 
		site has its own viewing page.  These pages are symbolized by <%PrintSymb "Viewing", "none"%>.
		</p>

		<p align=left class=BodyText>
		<b><i>Property Pages:</i></b> 
		Each item on your site has a specific set of properties.  When a site-goer creates a new item, he/she must define 
		those properties.  Furthermore, when a site-goer wishes to edit an existing item (that he/she created originally), 
		he/she must change initial properties.  The pages that allow one to manipulate an item's properties are called 
		property pages and have the symbol <%PrintSymb "Property", "none"%>.
		</p>

		<p align=left class=BodyText>
		<b><i>Confirmation Pages:</i></b> 
		These pages load after a site-goer has completed an action on the site.  For example, when a guest adds a 
		message post, a confirmation page will load to verify that his/her message has been added.  The symbol for 
		confirmation pages is <%PrintSymb "Confirmation", "photo has been deleted.GIF"%>.
		</p>

		<p align=left class=BodyText>
		<b><i>List Pages:</i></b> 
		A list page is just a chronological catalogue of items such as posts, photos, categories, members, etc.  
		When a site-goer first enters a section area, he/she is shown a list page that contains all of that section's 
		items.  The symbol for a list page is <%PrintSymb "List", "none"%>.
		</p>


		<p align=left class=BodyText>
		<b><i>Search Result Pages:</i></b> 
		Similar to a list page, this type of page is an index of all items returned by a search.  The items of a 
		search result page however, are ordered slightly differently than a list page.  Items most closely matching 
		your search request are listed first.  These pages are symbolized by <%PrintSymb "Search", "none"%>.
		</p>

		<p align=left class=BodyText>
		<b><i>Log-In Page:</i></b> 
		This page will load when a site-goer attempts to reach a section or perform an action that is designated 
		members and/or administrators only.  The symbol for the log-in page is <%PrintSymb "Login", ""%>.
		</p>

	</blockquote>


	<p align=left class=BodyText>
	<%PrintBullet%><span class=SubHeading>More on Page Types - </span>
	There are a few special symbols given to certain pages.  The word <b>New</b> in parenthesis immediately after a 
	page symbol means the designated page is new and not the same one from the previous step.  In other words, 
	if there are two consecutive steps that each start from two different pages of the same type, the latter 
	step's page symbol will begin with contain (New).  Conversely, when two consecutive steps both start from 
	the same identical page (when the former step does not load a new page), the latter's page symbol will 
	end with <b>(Same)</b>.
	</p>

	<p align=left class=BodyText>
	<b>Note:</b> 
	Warning or notice boxes pop up on your screen after you click certain action buttons.  These are not considered 
	true webpages but still have a symbol: <%PrintSymb "Popup", "none"%>.  Similarly, clicking a <b>Browse</b> button 
	(you will learn about these later) will open a directory box denoted by <%PrintSymb "Browse", "none"%>.
	</p>
