<p align=left class=BodyText><span class=Heading><%=intChapter%>.1 SITE STATS: </span>&nbsp;
When we created GroupLoop.com, we wanted a fun way you to track the progress of your site.  So, we created a 
stats page.  The number of home page hits, site searches, and the number of items in a section are some of the stats 
displayed.  It also gives a detailed list of all the most popular and highest rated posts in each section.  Also, 
when a member's name is clicked on, you will see a page much like the site stats, but it is just for that specific 
member (a highlights page).  Check your stats page often and see how many times you have to rate one of your stories 
to bring it to the top of the list (cheater)!

<p align=left class=BodyText><span class=Heading><%=intChapter%>.4 CUSTOM SERVICES: </span>&nbsp;
Although your site has many sections and features, we understand that you may need something extra.  Perhaps you would 
like a Pet Peeves section, or an archived Newsletter.  Well, we took that into consideration when we created your site's 
design.  It is easier (and cheaper) than you think to get an extra section for your site.  We have a professional, 
helpful team of programmers and designers ready to take on your custom needs.  Simply click on Modify Account in the Members section.  There you will be 
given a list of options.  Click on Request Custom Graphics/Sections.  You will be taken to a page that 
will ask for your billing information to confirm it's you.  Then you can request the work you need done.  We will be 
in contact with you to give you an estimate and get a clear idea of what you are asking for.  
We can have your new section ready in as little as a day!
