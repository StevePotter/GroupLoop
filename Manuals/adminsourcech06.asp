<p align=left class=BodyText><span class=Heading><%=intChapter%>.1 SECTIONS: </span>&nbsp;
As you have most likely already learned, your site is organize into sections.  Each of the possible thousands of 
pages that make up your site fits into one of these sections.  Although these individual sections are explained 
in much greater detail in the Member's Manual, we will supply you with a brief explanation of each section:
</p>

	<p align=left class=BodyText>
	<b><i>About Us: </i></b>
	The About Us section is a single viewing page that contains a description of your site, and any other information 
	you would like guests to know.
	</p>

	<p align=left class=BodyText>
	<b><i>News: </i></b>
	The news section has no link in the section menu because it appears directly on the home page.  News updates 
	can only be written by the administrator and are usually intended to keep site-goers informed of your site's 
	latest news.  This section can also be made to display the current day's calendar events (calendar section 
	explained below).
	</p>

	<p align=left class=BodyText>
	<b><i>Latest Additions: </i></b>
	The latest additions is another section that has no link in the section menu.  This section appears directly 
	below the news section and optional text on the home page.  Your site will automatically create links in this section to all 
	your site's most recent member and guest additions.  The number of days a link stays in the latest additions 
	section is specified by the administrator.
	</p>

	<p align=left class=BodyText>
	<b><i>Members: </i></b>
	The members section can only be accessed by site members.  This section contains the members menu - a list 
	of links to all special member options.  This section also contains your administrator options (don't worry, 
	members cannot see them nor can they access them).
	</p>

	<p align=left class=BodyText>
	<b><i>Announcements: </i></b>
	The announcements section contains brief member written posts typically similar to new updates in content.
	</p>

	<p align=left class=BodyText>
	<b><i>Stories: </i></b>
	The posts in the stories section are also member written but are usually much longer than announcements.  Most 
	GroupLoop site members use this section to tell personal narratives about weekend parties, sports games, 
	family gatherings, etc.
	</p>

	<p align=left class=BodyText>
	<b><i>Quotes: </i></b>
	The quotes section is simply a listing of member posted quotes.  Each quote contains a brief description 
	about the quote's owner and context.
	</p>

	<p align=left class=BodyText>
	<b><i>Calendar: </i></b>
	The calendar section is just that - a calendar of passed or upcoming events.  Only members can post calendar 
	events.  Your site can also be made to automatically insert each member's birthday into the calendar - that 
	is, only if the particular member remembered to enter his/her birthday in the member section's personal info.
	</p>

	<p align=left class=BodyText>
	<b><i>Links: </i></b>
	The links section is simply a listing of various websites posted by members.
	</p>

	<p align=left class=BodyText>
	<b><i>Guestbook: </i></b>
	The guestbook section is an area where only guests can post.
	</p>

	<p align=left class=BodyText>
	<b><i>Message Forum: </i></b>
	The message forum section is most likely going to be your busiest section.  Most GroupLoop message forums 
	have thousands upon thousands of message posts within a year.  Although members and guests alike can be given 
	the ability (by you) to reply to nearly every type of site addition, most back and forth conversation takes 
	place in the message forum; its unique organization makes finding, posting, and replying to message posts very 
	convenient.
	</p>

	<p align=left class=BodyText>
	<b><i>Photos: </i></b>
	The photos section is consistently one of our most asked about and popular sections.  The administrator and 
	even members (if you grant them the ability) can add digitized photographs to the photos section in the form 
	of computer image files.  Members also have the ability to add captions to photos.
	</p>

	<p align=left class=BodyText>
	<b><i>Voting: </i></b>
	The voting section holds various multiple choice poll questions that are composed by the administrator or 
	members (if you allow them).  Each voting poll tabulates its results and depicts them on a bar graph.
	</p>

	<p align=left class=BodyText>
	<b><i>Quizzes: </i></b>
	The quiz section is similar to the voting.  However, each quiz has several multiple choice questions each with 
	one correct answer.  After a site-goer takes a quiz, he/she was be told which questions he/she got 
	wrong and the percentage correct.
	</p>

	<p align=left class=BodyText>
	<b><i>Site Stats: </i></b>
	Your site automatically records the number of visits each item (ie. home page, story, quiz, calendar event, etc.) receives.  
	Your site also gives site-goers the ability to rate nearly every type of site item.  The site stats section then 
	calculates and posts tables displaying the most viewed and highest rated items from each section.  In addition, 
	each member has an individual site stats page that contains solely items authored by that member (their own highlights page).
	</p>

<p align=left class=BodyText><span class=Heading><%=intChapter%>.2 SECTION PROPERTIES: </span>&nbsp;
Each section has properties that can be changed by the administrator.  The four most common section properties 
are status, title, rating, and reviewing:
</p>

	<p align=left class=BodyText>
	<b><i>Section Status: </i></b>
	The status property of each of your sections is by default set to on.  If the section status is turned off 
	for a particular section, all links and member/administrator options pertaining to that section will be 
	removed from view.  The section and all its items will still exist, but will be hidden from sight.  When 
	you turn a section's status back on, your site will retrieve the section and all of its items.
	</p>

	<p align=left class=BodyText>
	<b><i>Section Title: </i></b>
	The section title is simply the name of a section.  We recommend you keep these as their defaults for a while 
	because changing them may confuse new members still reading the Member's Manual.  But for example, one customer 
	renamed the Stories section to Weekend Update.  The title gets changed everywhere in the site.
	</p>

	<p align=left class=BodyText>
	<b><i>Section Rating: </i></b>
	Site-goers are able to rate the items of nearly every section.  These individual ratings are averaged and 
	displayed next to each item.  The highest rated items of each particular section are listed on the site 
	stats page.  As administrator, you are able to turn the rating feature of any section off.
	</p>

	<p align=left class=BodyText>
	<b><i>Section Reviews: </i></b>
	Similar to ratings, site-goers are also able to attach short reviews to nearly every type of site item.  Like 
	ratings, you can also turn off the review feature for the items of any section.
	</p>

	<p align=left class=BodyText>
	<%PrintBullet%><span class=SubHeading>Altering Section Properties - </span>
	The section properties detailed above are present in nearly every section.  Any additional section properties 
	are for the most part self-explanatory - the ones that aren't are detailed within the following procedure:
	</p>

	<blockquote>

		<b><i>1 <%PrintSymb "Member", ""%>:</i></b>

			anywhere it appears on the site.
			<br>
			<%PrintArrow%><b><i>Items Per Page: </i></b> 
			Under the Other subheading, the items per page property dictates the number of items that will
