<p align=left class=BodyText><span class=Heading><%=intChapter%>.1 THE HOME PAGE: </span>&nbsp;
After you enter your site address into your web browser, you will be taken to the home page of your site.  
It's a good idea to bookmark the home 
page (press ctrl + D).
</p>

	<p align=left class=BodyText>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	You will see a menu down the side of the screen.  That menu is always there, no matter what page you are on.  Same 
	with the title at the top.  On the home page, you can read the latest news (if you don't see any, that's because 
	the administrators haven't written any) and view the latest site additions.  This is really convienent because it will 
	eliminate searching through all the sections for new additions.
	</p>

	<p align=left class=BodyText>
	<b>Note:</b> Because GroupLoop.com sites can be extremely customized, some things in this manual may not be the same 
	for your particular site.  For example, the section menu can be on the left, top, and right side of your screen.  
	Also, some sections and options that we mention here may have been turned off by the administrator.  This manual 
	describes your site using the most typical and most common options, so don't freak out if something isn't there.  
	The adminstrator(s) want it that way.
	</p>

<p align=left class=BodyText><span class=Heading><%=intChapter%>.2 SECTIONS: </span>&nbsp;
The menu on the side of the screen shows you all of the site's sections.  Each section is just a different part of your 
website.  Here is a quick explanation of each possible section:
</p>

	<p align=left class=BodyText>
	<b><i>About Us: </i></b>
	The About Us section is a simple, single viewing page that contains a description of your site, and any other 
	information guests should know.
	</p>

	<p align=left class=BodyText>
	<b><i>News: </i></b>
	The news section has no link in the section menu because it appears directly on the home page.  News updates 
	can only be written by the administrator and are usually intended to keep site-goers informed of your site's 
	latest news.  This section can also be made to display the current day's calendar events.
	</p>

	<p align=left class=BodyText>
	<b><i>Latest Additions: </i></b>
	The latest additions is another section that has no link in the section menu.  This section appears directly 
	below the news section and optional text on the home page.  Your site will automatically create links in this section to all 
	your site's most recent member and guest additions.  The number of days a link stays in the latest additions 
	section is specified by the administrator.
	</p>

	<p align=left class=BodyText>
	<b><i>Members: </i></b>
	The members section can only be accessed by site members.  This section contains the members menu - a list 
	of links to all special member options.
	</p>

	<p align=left class=BodyText>
	<b><i>Announcements: </i></b>
	The announcements section contains brief member written posts typically similar to new updates in content.
	</p>

	<p align=left class=BodyText>
	<b><i>Stories: </i></b>
	The posts in the stories section are also member written but are usually much longer than announcements.  Most 
	GroupLoop site members use this section to tell personal narratives about weekend parties, sports games, 
	family gatherings, etc.
	</p>

	<p align=left class=BodyText>
	<b><i>Quotes: </i></b>
	The quotes section is simply a listing of member posted quotes.  Each quote contains a brief description 
	about the quote's owner and context.
	</p>

	<p align=left class=BodyText>
	<b><i>Calendar: </i></b>
	The calendar section is just that - a calendar of passed or upcoming events.  Only members can post calendar 
	events.  Your site can also be made to automatically insert each member's birthday into the calendar - that 
	is, only if the particular member remembered to enter his/her birthday in the member section's personal info.
	</p>

	<p align=left class=BodyText>
	<b><i>Links: </i></b>
	The links section is simply a listing of various websites posted by members.
	</p>

	<p align=left class=BodyText>
	<b><i>Guestbook: </i></b>
	The guestbook section is an area where only guests can post.
	</p>

	<p align=left class=BodyText>
	<b><i>Message Forum: </i></b>
	The message forum section is most likely going to be your busiest section.  Most GroupLoop message forums 
	have thousands upon thousands of message posts within a year.  Most back and forth conversation takes 
	place in the message forum; its unique organization makes finding, posting, and replying to message posts very 
	convenient.
	</p>

	<p align=left class=BodyText>
	<b><i>Photos: </i></b>
	The photos section is consistently one of our most asked about and popular sections.  The administrator and 
	even members (if you grant them the ability) can add digitized photographs to the photos section in the form 
	of computer image files.  Members also have the ability to add captions to photos.
	</p>

	<p align=left class=BodyText>
	<b><i>Voting: </i></b>
	The voting section holds various multiple choice poll questions that are composed by the administrator or 
	members (if you allow them).  Each voting poll tabulates its results and depicts them on a bar graph.
	</p>

	<p align=left class=BodyText>
	<b><i>Quizzes: </i></b>
	The quiz section is similar to the voting.  However, each quiz has several multiple choice questions each with 
	one correct answer.  After a site-goer takes a quiz, he/she was be told which questions he/she got 
	wrong and the percentage correct.
	</p>

	<p align=left class=BodyText>
	<b><i>Site Stats: </i></b>
	Your site automatically records the number of visits each item (ie. home page, story, quiz, calendar event, etc.) receives.  
	Your site also gives site-goers the ability to rate nearly every type of site item.  The site stats section then 
	calculates and posts tables displaying the most viewed and highest rated items from each section.  In addition, 
	each member has an individual site stats page that contains solely items authored by that member (their own highlights page).
	</p>


	<p align=left class=BodyText>
	<b>Note:</b> The administrators can configure the way each section operates.  One option is to allow or not allow 
	regular members to post.  For example, an administrator may only want herself to be able to post Voting Polls.  
	So, when you click Add a Voting Poll, it will tell you that you don't have access.  You can still vote on the 
	Members Only polls, but you just can't add one.  And if you want to add one, you may write an angry e-mail threatening 
	to kidnap the administrator if they don't allow members to add polls (as the member of one of our Mafia sites did).  
	However, we are nice people at GroupLoop and only condone kidnapping for money.

<p align=left class=BodyText><span class=Heading><%=intChapter%>.3 SIGNING IN: </span>&nbsp;
To reach the main member page and all of your member options you must first sign in.  Use 
the following procedure to sign in (for info explaining procedures and their symbols, see the previous chapter):
	<blockquote>
		<b><i>1 <%PrintSymb "Home", ""%>:</i></b>  
		On the section menu to the far left, click on the section link labeled Members.  This link will open the log-in page.
		<br>
		<b><i>2 <%PrintSymb "Login", ""%>:</i></b>  
		Enter your member info and click the <a href="#">Log-In button</a>.<br>
		<blockquote>
			<%PrintArrow%><b><i>Password:</i></b> When you enter your password into the Password textbox, it will appear as 
			x's on your screen for security reasons.<br>
			<%PrintArrow%><b><i>Oops:</i></b> If you have forgotten your nickname and/or password, you can find it in 
			the email we sent to you when you signed up.  If you can't find that email, you 
			can email your adminstrator, who can get your password.  Please don't e-mail us, because we can't release 
			passwords to anyone but the site owner.<br>
		</blockquote>
		<b><i>3 <%PrintSymb "Member", ""%>:</i></b>  
		You made it!  You may want to bookmark this page (press ctrl + D).
		<br>
	</blockquote>

<a name="4"></a>
<p align=left class=BodyText><span class=Heading><%=intChapter%>.4 THE MEMBER TUTORIAL: </span>&nbsp;
Now that you know how to get to the members section (previous procedure), we will supply you with one brief 
example of each of the three types of member capabilities (adding, editing, deleting).
</p>
	<p align=left class=BodyText>
	<%PrintBullet%><span class=SubHeading>Addition - </span>
	Here we will create an Announcement:
	<blockquote>
		<b><i>1 <%PrintSymb "Member", ""%>:</i></b>  
		Click the Add an Announcement link under the Announcements subheading.
		<br>
		<b><i>2:</i></b>  
		Enter "Does This Work?" for the Subject, and "Yes, it does." for the Body.  You don't have to click the Private box.
		<br>
		<b><i>3 <%PrintSymb "Create", "add announcement.gif"%>:</i></b>  
		Click the Add button.
		<br>
		<b><i>4:</i></b>  
		The announcement has been added.  A link is provided to add another, if you wish.
	</blockquote>


	<p align=left class=BodyText>
	<%PrintBullet%><span class=SubHeading>Editing - </span>
	Now we are going to change the announcement we just created:
	<blockquote>
		<b><i>1 <%PrintSymb "Member", ""%>:</i></b>  
		Click the Modify Announcements link under the Announcements subheading.
		<br>
		<b><i>2 <%PrintSymb "List", "list first announcement.gif"%>:</i></b>  
		Find the "Does This Work?" announcement, which should be the only one there.
		<br>
		<b><i>3:</i></b>  
		Click the Edit button to the post's far right.
		<br>
		<b><i>3 <%PrintSymb "Edit", "edit first announcement.gif"%>: </i></b> 
		Change the Subject line to "Anyone seen Turtle Boxing?".
		<br>	
		<b><i>4: </i></b> 
		Click the Update button beneath the body textbox.
		<br>	
	</blockquote>

	<p align=left class=BodyText>
	That's it!  The announcement now reads "Anyone seen Turtle Boxing?".  
	</p>


	<p align=left class=BodyText>
	<%PrintBullet%><span class=SubHeading>Deleting - </span>
	Since noone likes nonsense, we are going to delete our recently changed announcement:
	<blockquote>
		<b><i>1 <%PrintSymb "Member", ""%>:</i></b>  
		Click the Modify Announcements link under the Announcements subheading.
		<br>
		<b><i>2 <%PrintSymb "List", "list first announcement.gif"%>:</i></b>  
		Find the "Does This Work?" announcement and click the Delete button to its right.
		<br>
		<b><i>3 <%PrintSymb "PopUp", "delete first announcement popup.gif"%>: </i></b> 
		When this box pops up, click OK.  This gives you a chance to back out of deleting an item 
		by accident.
	</blockquote>

	<p align=left class=BodyText>
	We did it! The announcement is gone.  Starting to get the feel now?  Keep on going!
	</p>


	<p align=left class=BodyText>
	<%PrintBullet%><span class=SubHeading>Good Luck! - </span>
	Well, we hope you're starting to get a feel for the site.  Continue reading this manual, but remember 
	you don't have to absorb everything on the first go.  Nor must you read the manual straight through.  
	If you're looking to perform a particular task, find the chapter concerning that topic in the Table of 
	Contents and read up on it.  Good luck and have fun!
