<p align=left class=BodyText><span class=Heading><%=intChapter%>.1 YOUR SITE ADDRESS: </span>&nbsp;
When you signed up for this service, you submitted a site name (if you forgot it, check your 
sign-up confirmation email). The site address you were assigned is www.GroupLoop.com, plus a 
forward slash (/), plus your site name.
</p>

	<p align=left class=BodyText>
	<b>Note:</b> You can also get to your site by substituting www.GroupLoop.com with 
	www.OurPage.tv, or www.OurPage.ws  Entering any of these domains plus a forward slash (/) and 
	your chosen site name will direct your web browser to exactly the same place on the internet...so take your pick.
	</p>

	<p align=left class=BodyText>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	It is also possible to obtain a site address with just your site name as the domain (ie. 
	TomsFriends.com, ValleyHighSoccer.com, etc.com).  This option will cost a little extra (about 
	$25-$35 a year) as we will need to pay registration fees to a domain registry company to secure your 
	specific name.  If you already have your own domain name registered, we can move your new GroupLoop 
	site to that domain for a $2/ month server charge.  If you are interested in any of these features 
	email us at <a href="mailto:support@grouploop.com">support@grouploop.com</a>.
	</p>

<a name="2"></a>
<p align=left class=BodyText><span class=Heading><%=intChapter%>.2 THE HOME PAGE AND SECTIONS: </span>&nbsp;
After you enter your site address into your web browser, you will be taken to the home page of your site.  
If you don't like the way it looks, don't worry!  You're the administrator, remember? You will be able to 
change every page on your site to your liking whenever you desire.  It's a good idea to bookmark the home 
page (press ctrl + D).
</p>

	<p align=left class=BodyText>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	At the top of the home page is your site title (the default title should be your site name).  On the 
	left hand side of the home page is the section menu.  Sections are the different areas that make up 
	your site (sections are described in much greater detail in the Member's Manual.  Read it first!).  Each 
	link under the section menu, when clicked on, will send you to a different section of your site.
	</p>

<a name="3"></a>
<p align=left class=BodyText><span class=Heading><%=intChapter%>.3 SIGNING IN: </span>&nbsp;
To reach the main member page and all of your administrative options you must first sign in.  Use 
the following procedure to sign in (for info explaining procedures and their symbols, see the previous chapter):
	<blockquote>
		<b><i>1 <%PrintSymb "Home", ""%>:</i></b>  
		On the section menu to the far left, click on the section link labeled Members.  This link will open the log-in page.
		<br>
		<b><i>2 <%PrintSymb "Login", ""%>:</i></b>  
		Enter your administrator info and click the <a href="#">Log-In button</a>.<br>
		<blockquote>
			<%PrintArrow%><b><i>Password:</i></b> When you enter your password into the Password textbox, it will appear as 
			x's on your screen for security reasons.<br>
			<%PrintArrow%><b><i>Oops:</i></b> If you have forgotten your nickname and/or password, you can find it in 
			the confirmation email we sent to you when you signed up.  If you can't find that confirmation email, you 
			can email us at <a href="mailto:support@grouploop.com">support@grouploop.com</a> for help (please include your 
			full name and the last 4 digits of the Credit Card used to sign up) for help.<br>
		</blockquote>
		<b><i>3 <%PrintSymb "Member", ""%>:</i></b>  
		You made it!  You may want to bookmark this page (press ctrl + D).
		<br>
	</blockquote>

<a name="4"></a>
<p align=left class=BodyText><span class=Heading><%=intChapter%>.4 THE ADMINISTRATOR TUTORIAL: </span>&nbsp;
Now that you know how to get to the members section (previous procedure), we will supply you with one brief 
example of each of the four types of administrator capabilities <a href="ch01.asp?#2">(Chapter 1.2)</a>.  On the far left-hand 
side, there is the same section menu as from the home page; the section menu appears on every  page of your site.
</p>

	<p align=left class=BodyText>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	Just to the right of the section menu is the administrator menu.  This is a listing of links that will allow 
	you to use all of your administrator options.  Don't let yourself feel overwhelmed by the menu's size; it's 
	not as complicated as it looks.  Right now you only need to know a small number of those administrator options.  
	As you learn more about your site, more of these options will come into play.
	</p>

	<p align=left class=BodyText>
	<%PrintBullet%><span class=SubHeading>Customization - </span>
	First, we'll take you through a procedure detailing one of your customization capabilities.  Specifically, 
	we will show you how you can change the look of your site by changing the main background color:
	<blockquote>
		<b><i>1 <%PrintSymb "Member", ""%>:</i></b>  
			Click on the Change Basic Visuals link under the Visual Customization subheading.
		<br>
		<b><i>2:</i></b>  
			Find the Background Color pull-down menu under the Main Pages subheading.
		<br>
		<b><i>3 <%PrintSymb "Edit", "tutorial background change.gif"%>:</i></b>  
		Change the color to anything you please.
		<blockquote>
			<%PrintArrow%><b><i>Color Problems?:</i></b> If you cannot see colors in the pull-down menu, 
			click the <b>Color Problems?</b> link at the top of the page.  The page will reload with 
			a different color selection process.  If you do have this problem, you may need to update your browser.  
			Netscape users go to <a href="http://www.netscape.com">Netscape.com</a>, and Internet Explorer users go to 
			<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/ie">Microsoft.com</a> to download the newest version.  This should correct the 
			problem.
		</blockquote>
		<b><i>4:</i></b>  
		Scroll to the bottom of the page and click the Update button.
		<br>
		<b><i>5 <%PrintSymb "Confirmation", "tutorial background has been changed.gif"%>:</i></b>  
		Once the options have been updated, click on the provided link to return to the main member page.

	</blockquote>

	<p align=left class=BodyText>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	Congratulations!  You just performed your first task as administrator.  The background of <i>all</i> 
	your pages should now be in the new color.  If you don't like the way it looks, change it whenever you like.  
	</p>

	<p align=left class=BodyText>
	<b>Note:</b> Although any changes can be reversed, we recommend you don't experiment with any of the 
	other customization features just yet; this manual refers to specific positioning and wording characteristics 
	that should be present as defaults.  Changing the look of your GroupLoop site before you understand the 
	basics of how it works may lead to confusion with certain points of reference that are assumed by this manual.	
	</p>


	<p align=left class=BodyText>
	<%PrintBullet%><span class=SubHeading>Editing - </span>
	Next, you will be given an example of altering a site-goer's post.  Since you probably have no member or 
	guest posts yet (if you do your site's really moving!), we've provided your site with a couple of samples.  
	In this procedure, we will delete fictional member <b>Mark's</b> announcement entitled <b>Hello!</b>:
	<blockquote>
		<b><i>1 <%PrintSymb "Member", ""%>:</i></b>  
		Click the Modify Announcements link under the Announcements subheading.
		<br>
		<b><i>2 <%PrintSymb "List", "tutorial modify announcement.gif"%>:</i></b>  
		Find the Hello! announcement by Mark.
		<br>
		<b><i>3:</i></b>  
		Click the Delete button to the post's far right.
		<br>
		<b><i>4 <%PrintSymb "PopUp", "tutorial delete announcement popup.gif"%>:</i></b>  
		Since you want to delete this, click OK.
		<br>
		<b><i>5 <%PrintSymb "Confirmation", "tutorial announcement has been deleted.gif"%>:</i></b>  
		Click on Announcements to inspect your deletion.
		<br>
		<b><i>5 <%PrintSymb "List", "tutorial empty announcement list.gif"%>:</i></b>  
		See?  It's gone!

	</blockquote>

	<p align=left class=BodyText>
	That's it!  The <b>Hello!</b> announcement should no longer be in the announcements area, nor anywhere else on your site.
	</p>

	<p align=left class=BodyText>
	<%PrintBullet%><span class=SubHeading>Categorization - </span>
	To demonstrate one of your categorization capabilities, we will take you through adding a message 
	forum topic (there is already a default topic named General but you will learn how to edit or remove 
	this topic later on):
	<blockquote>
		<b><i>1 <%PrintSymb "Member", ""%>:</i></b>  
		Click the Add A New Topic link under the Message Forum subheading.
		<br>
		<b><i>2 <%PrintSymb "Create", "tutorial add topic"%>:</i></b>  
		Assign the new forum topic its properties.
		<blockquote>
			<%PrintArrow%><b><i>Privacy:</i></b> For these option bubbles select the fully public option 
			bubble (the first one).  Privacy will be described in greater detail later.<br>
			<%PrintArrow%><b><i>Topic Name:</i></b> Enter a name of your choosing for the topic (Trips, Site Stuff, Cars, etc).
		</blockquote>
		<b><i>3:</i></b>  
		Click the Add button.
		<br>
		<b><i>4 <%PrintSymb "Confirmation", "tutorial topic has been added.gif"%>:</i></b>  
		The topic has been added.  A link is provided to add another, if you wish.
	</blockquote>


	<p align=left class=BodyText>
	<%PrintBullet%><span class=SubHeading>Addition - </span>
	Finally, an example of your addition capabilities is adding a new member to your site.  Follow this procedure:
	<blockquote>
		<b><i>1 <%PrintSymb "Member", ""%>:</i></b>  
		Click the Add a New Member link under the Members subheading.
		<br>
		<b><i>2 <%PrintSymb "Create", "tutorial add member"%>:</i></b>  
		Enter the info and properties for the new membership.
		<blockquote>
			<%PrintArrow%><b><i>Nickname:</i></b> For this textbox enter a name the member is commonly called
			or even choose an off-the-wall nickname.  Just remember that every member's nickname must be unique.  
			The new member is able to change it whenever he/she wants so feel free to have fun with thinking one up (we'd give recommmendations, 
			but we care about your health).<br>
			<%PrintArrow%><b><i>Password:</i></b> Enter a password into the Password textbox that won't be 
			particularly obvious (such as their last name or just 'password').  The member will be able to 
			change the password too, so don't lose sleep over your choice. <br>
			<%PrintArrow%><b><i>Email:</i></b> Entering the new member's email address is recommended but not required.  
			If you don't know your new member's email address, it's ok!  Just leave the email textbox blank.  
			If you wish for the new member to be notified by email, click the email notification checkbox just below 
			the email address textbox.<br>
			<%PrintArrow%><b><i>Administrator Access:</i></b> We strongly recommend you leave this checkbox 
			unmarked for the time being.  If you do decide to grant your new member administrator access, 
			realize that he/she will have all the same capabilities as you (which could equal bad news)!
		</blockquote>

		<b><i>3:</i></b>  
		Click the Add button.
		<br>
		<b><i>4 <%PrintSymb "Confirmation", "tutorial member has been added.gif"%>:</i></b>  
		The member has been added.  A link is provided to add another, if you wish.
	</blockquote>

	<p align=left class=BodyText>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	The email feature in the Add A Member administrator option will automatically send an email to 
	your new member explaining the site.  If you didn't know your new member's email address, you'll 
	need to call them and let them know of their new free membership to your site.  Also, if 
	you like, go back and add a few more members for practice.  You'll have to do add everyone eventually.
	</p>
