When we created GroupLoop.com, we wanted a fun way you to track the progress of your site.  So, we created a 
stats page.  The number of home page hits, site searches, and the number of items in a section are some of the stats 
displayed.  It also gives a detailed list of all the most popular and highest rated posts in each section.  Also, 
when a member's name is clicked on, you will see a page much like the site stats, but it is just for that specific 
member (a highlights page).  Check your stats page often and see how many times you have to rate one of your stories 
to bring it to the top of the list (cheater)!
