<p class="Heading" align=center>Samples</p>
We've done our best to explain how great these sites are.  However, we feel (and you probably agree) 
that you won't get the full effect until you see it for yourself.  So, we've provided some 
sample sites for you to check out.

<p><a href="http://www.bbpc.org" target="_blank">bbpc.org</a>: a church, using our multiple-site system</p>
<p><a href="http://www.GroupLoop.com/VTLax" target="_blank">GroupLoop.com/VTLax</a>: a team’s site intended for posting stats and talking sports</P>
<p><a href="http://www.GroupLoop.com/2" target="_blank">PottersPage.com</a>: a family spread out across the country, keeping in touch</P>

<p class="Heading" align=center>Be an Administrator or Member</p>
You can see above what these sites look like.  How would you like a test drive at being a member or 
an administrator of your own site?  If you don't know the difference, here's a quick explanation.  Members 
of your site can participate in all the different sections.  An administrator is a member, but with 
special privalages.  They can add/edit/delete memberships, posts, and site sections.  They can also 
change the colors, graphics, and other visual aspects of the site.

<p>To log in as an <b>administrator</b>, <a href="http://www.GroupLoop.com/testadmin/login.asp?NickName=Sarah&Password=password&Source=index.asp" target="_blank">click here</a>.  You will be automatically signed in.<br>
