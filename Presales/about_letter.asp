<p align="center" class=Heading>Letter From President Stephen Potter</p>
<p>
Thank you for your interest in GroupLoop.  GroupLoop is a company fueled by the passion of its employees.  We love what we do.  It's that simple.  
And as a result, people love dealing with us.
</p>

<p>
No one provides a service like ours.  GroupLoop sites are unique.  We are dedicated to constantly improving our system.  I personally make sure that 
customer suggestions are noted and often implemented.
</p>

<p>
GroupLoop has always stayed true to it's one core principle - allowing people to really take advantage of the Internet.  
Until now, sites like what GroupLoop offers were exclusive, rare, and expensive.  The excitement grows daily, as we constantly 
achieve the little goals which make up our true dream - to become an influential Internet powerhouse, doing what we enjoy.
</p>

<p>
I urge you to join GroupLoop either by signing up for a site or our sales program.  Both are equally rewarding.  If you have an idea for us, or would 
like to arrange something with me personally, please e-mail me at <a href="mailto:president@grouploop.com">president@grouploop.com</a>.
</p>

<p>
Sincerely,<br>
Stephen Potter<br>
President, GroupLoop.com
