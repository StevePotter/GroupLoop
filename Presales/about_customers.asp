<p>
Customer satisfaction is our most important value.  We work hard to make every customer happy with their web site.  Below 
are a few examples of our customers' success.
</p>

<p>
Customer: <b>Bound Brook Presbyterian Church</b><br>
Address: <b><a href="http://www.bbpc.org">www.bbpc.org</a></b><br>
"This is a new generation of Web Sites.  This is not just presenting information.  It is a tool to advance our community's 
work - building, helping to overcome the separateness of our lives.  In the same way as a family found itself spread apart 
and used this to keep close, so too for the church the tool becomes a gift."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Rev. Louis Kilgore

Customer: <b>Virginia Tech Men's Lacrosse</b><br>
Address: <b><a href="http://www.grouploop.com/VTLax">www.GroupLoop.com/VTLax</a></b><br>
The VT lacrosse team wanted a site that could easily give visitors team updates, and allow team members and alumni 
to communicate.  Our <a href="multisite.asp">multi-site system</a> was the best solution.  With a main team site and child sites for the players and 
alumni, the brand new site has met with much success.

Customer: <b>Shimon and Sara Birnbaum Jewish Community Center</b><br>
Address: <b><a href="http://www.ssbjcc.org">www.ssbjcc.org</a></b><br>
GroupLoop was called to update the JCC's Web Site to an interactive community which could easily be maintained by 
staff who had no prior Web experience.  GroupLoop allowed them to maintain an online catalog of classes, send out their 
monthly newsletter, and keep members posted to the latest happenings.
