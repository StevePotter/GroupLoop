<p class="Heading" align=center>GroupLoop v2.0</p>
GroupLoop is a young, expanding company.  Originally our sites were quite simple, but as we got more customers, a huge demand 
for new features, sections, and options arose.  We want to meet the demands of our current and future customers.  Version 2.0 has accomplished 
exactly that.  The new GroupLoop is easier to use, and will provide you with the power to quickly expand your site as it changes.
