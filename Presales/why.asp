<p class="Heading" align=center>Why?</p>

<p>You must only answer two questions:<br>
1.  <a href="#1">Does your group need an interactive forum?</a><br>
2.  <a href="#2">Will GroupLoop provide what your group needs?</a><br>
If you can answer yes to both these questions, you should join us.

<a name="1">
<p align="center" class=SubHeading>Does your group need an interactive forum?</p>
This should be a simple yes if:<br>
	<ul>
	  <li>People in your group lead separate lives</li>
	  <li>Your group needs a home on the Web</li>
	  <li>You want to archive your group's communication</li>
	  <li>You enjoy having fun online</li>
	</ul>
GroupLoop is perfect for almost any group:<br>
	<ul>
	  <li>Families</li>
	  <li>Friends</li>
	  <li>Religious Organizations</li>
	  <li>Sports Clubs/Leagues</li>
	  <li>PTAs</li>
	  <li>Co-Workers</li>
	  <li>Organizations/Committees</li>
	</ul>

<p align="center" class=SubHeading>Will GroupLoop provide what your group needs?</p>

<p>GroupLoop.com gives your group a personal forum. Your Web Site 
lets you chit-chat about everyday topics, post stories about recent 
events, make group announcements, tell jokes, display photos, set up polls and quizzes, post contact info...the 
list goes on and on.
</p>

<p>
<b>If you have a complex group</b> with committees (such as a Deacon's board), we can create sites for each committee.   So what?<br>
Think about it.  If each committee had it's own communication center, and each site was linked, your organization would maintain its structure.  
Don't bunch everything into one place, because that's not how it's done.  We will personally create a true web community for you that will allow your group's 
committees to achieve effective communication.  Write to <a href="mailto:accounts@grouploop.com">accounts@grouploop.com</a> today, and ask us how we can help 
your group.
</p>

<p>
Here’s the best part: you can customize the site to include exactly what you want! Add your 
own members. Pick your own colors, titles, features and graphics. Make section areas public or members only. It’s 
up to you! You choose the look, feel, and setup of your site using a simple step-by-step outline.  <i>Even the most 
computer illiterate user can create their very own site.</i>
</p>



<p align="center" class=SubHeading>The Bottom Line</p>
<p>GroupLoop.com is the <b>only</b> provider of complete interactive group e-communities.  To get a site like this, you 
would have to pay thousands of dollars to a web designer or spend years learning to  
program the code involved, and then still pay a host.
