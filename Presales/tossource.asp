<p>Upon signing up for your site, you must aggree that you have read and accept the Terms Of Service.  
This is extremely important, so please do your best to get through it.</p>

<p>
	<b>1. ACCEPTANCE OF TERMS</b><br>
	OurPage LLC (GroupLoop.com) provides its service to you, subject to the 
	following Terms of Service ("TOS"), which may be updated by us from time 
	to time without notice to you. You can review the most current version of 
	the TOS at any time at: <a href="http://www.GroupLoop.com/homegroup/tos.asp" 
	target="_top">http://www.GroupLoop.com/homegroup/tos.asp</a>.  When you sign up for 
	your site, you must verify that you have read and accept the TOS.
</p>

<p>
	<b>2. DESCRIPTION OF SERVICE</b><br>
	OurPage LLC provides customers with a feature-rich website for a group of people, each 
	member added by an administrator.  The administrator could be you, the site owner, or 
	another member whom you have given administrator access to.  Each site provides members 
	with sections to post items to.  Members may also modify their existing additions.  
	Administrators can change the site's options, look, and modify <b>any</b> member or their 
	additions.  Basically adminstrators can do anything to the site.
</p>
<p>
	<b>3. PRIVACY ON YOUR SITE</b><br>
	When a member posts an addition, he/she has the option to make it private.  Only a site member 
	can view a private post.  The OurPage LLC staff will <b>NOT</b> read any private or modify any 
	public or private item without a request from the Site Owner.  We understand and respect private 
	posts.
</p>
<p>
	<b>4. MEMBER ACCOUNT, PASSWORD AND SECURITY</b><br>
	Every member of your site uses a password to log into the Member's Only section.  The 
	log in pages do not necessarily use a SSL connection.  Please note that noone's password has ever been 
	'stolen'.  Security is a big issue with OurPage, and every measure to keeping your site secure 
	is taken.  Each member is responsible for maintaining the 
	confidentiality of the password and account, and are fully responsible for 
	all activities that occur under your password or account. You agree to 
	immediately notify OurPage of any unauthorized use of an site member's password or 
	account or any other breach of security.  OurPage LLC cannot and will not be 
	liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to comply with 
	this Section 5.
</p>
<p>
	<b>5. MEMBER CONDUCT</b><br>
