<p class="Heading" align=center>Secure Login Feature</p>
<p>
You have the ability to use a secure login whenever anyone signs in as a member.  This totally protects members' passwords.  
BUT, there is a disadvantage.  A secure connection is <b>MUCH</b> slower.  You will notice a very significant difference 
when you use the secure as opposed to the non-secure login.
</p>
<p>
We only recommend this feature only for people with extremely sensitive site content.  It is so unlikely that someone out there 
will try to steal any passwords from you.  Seriously, noone really cares.
