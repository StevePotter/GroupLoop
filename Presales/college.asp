<p class="Heading" align=center>Attention College Kids!</p>

<p>
If you are in high school or college, you should really consider a GroupLoop.com site.  &nbsp;This company was founded by 
college kids, and we know how tough it is to stay in touch with your old friends.  &nbsp;In fact, a site for group of 
high school buddies in college spawned GroupLoop.com.
</p>

<p>
Anyhow, we love the wacky sites from our younger customers. &nbsp;But, we realize that although $20/month isn't too expensive, 
it may be a bit much for some starving college kids.  &nbsp;Plus, if you plan on splitting the cost among each other, it's 
often tough to collect from people.  &nbsp;So pay attention to the referral program. &nbsp;All you have to do it get 
12 people to sign up within a year, and you got a free site! &nbsp;Think about that. &nbsp;If you have 12 members, everyone has 
to get just <b>one</b> person. &nbsp;Also, don't be scared to test out a site. &nbsp;Just cancel you account in 1 month or less, 
and you won't ever see a charge on your credit card.
</p>

<p>
We hope you sign up with us.  And if you think you got some good material, e-mail us and we'll check it out.
