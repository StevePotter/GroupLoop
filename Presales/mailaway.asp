<p class="Heading" align=center>Mail-Away Photo Option</p>
If you don't have access to a scanner, and would like us to scan and post your photos for you, simply 
do the following:<br>

<b>1. </b> Get all the photos together.<br>
<b>2. </b> Number the photos on the back, in pen or permanent marker (no pencil).<br>
<b>3. </b> On a separate piece of paper, include the following.
	<ul>
	<li>Your full name, address, phone number, and e-mail.</li>
	<li>Your site address (www.GroupLoop.com/raceclub), nickname, and password.</li>
	<li>A list, giving the description (optional), category, and any other information about each photo.  
	Please number the list according to the numbers on the back of each photo.  This will allow us to 
	properly categorize and describe each photo.  If we don't have the correct information, we will just 
	upload it to the first category.</li>
	<li>If you are the site owner, please write down your credit card number, so we can bill your account.  If 
	you aren't, please include a check for the proper amount (see below).</li>
	</ul>
<b>4. </b> Mail the above to:<br>
