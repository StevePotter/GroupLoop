<p>GroupLoop offers a unique service.  At the most basic level, we offer sites for groups of people to interact.  
But we have developed a system that goes way beyond that.  People need our service; however, we don't have the sales capacity we 
need.</p>
<p>
So, in efforts to expand our customer base, we have developed a unique sales program that benefits everyone.  You get an organization 
to sign up, and you receive 20% of what the customer pays for their site.  This isn't a one-time thing.  You get paid every month, <b>indefinetly,</b> 
as long as they have a site with us.  Most of these organziations pay about $100 for their sites.  It usually takes about half an hour to make a sale, 
and you don't do any work after that.  That means you can make up to $240 a year per site.  Get 100 customers, and you are making <b>$24,000 a year</b>.  Best 
of all, you don't have to lift a finger afterwards!  To learn more and sign up, please click on the link below.
