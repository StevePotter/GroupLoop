<p>
We offer powerful, versatile, interactive Web Sites for groups of people to communicate.  In the beginning, our customers 
were mostly families and groups of friends.  Then we developed a new system, which allows customers to have multiple linked 
sites.
</p>

<p align="center" class=SubHeading>
So who needs that?
</p>
<p>
All types of organizations.  However, our research has found that this system works best for churches and other 
religious organizations.<br>
<i>Here's how it works:</i><br>
Churches are divided into different 
committees.  The only real way for the committee members to interact is at their meetings.  If someone 
misses the meeting, they have to wait until the 
next meeting to find out what happened.
</p>

<p>Obviously this is a bad system.  The perfect solution would be a GroupLoop site for each committee.  And that's exactly what we developed.  With this 
system, churches have their main informational site, and child sites for each committee. 

The main site lets visitors and members know what's happening 
this week, announcements, sermons, etc.  This alone is a very valuable tool.  Each child site serves as a tool for its committee.  Members can 
communicate, and non-members can see what's happening.  Before this, people interested in the committee would have to attend its meetings.  And really, 
who is going to do that?
</p>

<p>
We hope now you understand the benefits of our system.  And churches are the perfect people to deal with.  They are nice, easy-going, and open to 
new things.  Our current customers love their site, and find it's worth every penny.  Many churches have up to 20 different sites!  Just check out the 
<a href="http://www.bbpc.org">Bound Brook Presbyterian Church</a>.  They have 19 sites.  Churches pay anywhere from $60 to $200 monthly for their sites.

Sounds good, what do I do?
</p>
<p>
Your job is simple.  We need new customers, and we are more than willing to give you a percentage.  In fact, we will give you 20% of each of your customers' 
monthly fee.  All you do is get them to sign up.  You do not provide support or other assistance.  That means you collect each month for doing nothing.  
Do some math.  You could end up making a lot of money.  Do some work, and add a few thousand dollars to your income.  Do a lot of selling, and 
you could make some real serious money.
