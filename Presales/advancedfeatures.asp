<p class="SubHeading">Sections</p>
	Don't think it's for your group?  Here's a list of all the sections you can (but don't have to) use.  What else 
	could you need?	
	<ul>
		<li>		
		<b><i>Information Pages: </i></b>
		Create unlimited informational pages such as group information, contact information, privacy notices, anything you feel like.
		</li>
		<li>
		<b><i>News: </i></b>
		The news section appears directly on the home page.  News updates are usually intended to 
		keep site-goers informed of your site's 
		latest news.  This section can also be made to display the current day's calendar events, and even wish members a happy birthday!
		</li>
		<li>
		<b><i>Latest Additions: </i></b>
		This section is located directly on the home page.  Your site will automatically create links 
		to all your site's most recent member and guest additions.
		</li>

		<li>
		<b><i>Announcements: </i></b>
		The announcements section contains brief member written posts typically similar to new updates in content.
		</li>
		<li>
		<b><i>Meeting Minutes: </i></b>
		Keep track of your group's meetings with this section.
		</li>
		<li>
		<b><i>Newsletter: </i></b>
		Send out an e-mail letter telling news, events, and other information to anyone who subscribes!
		</li>
		<li>
		<b><i>Stories: </i></b>
		The posts in the stories section are also member written but are usually much longer than announcements.  Most 
		GroupLoop site members use this section to tell personal narratives about weekend parties, sports games, 
		family gatherings, etc.
		</li>
		<li>
		<b><i>Quotes: </i></b>
		The quotes section is simply a listing of member posted quotes.  Each quote contains a brief description 
		about the quote's owner and context.
		</li>
		<li>
		<b><i>Calendar: </i></b>
		The calendar section is just that - a calendar of passed or upcoming events.  Only members can post calendar 
		events.  Your site can also be made to automatically insert each member's birthday into the calendar - that 
		is, only if the particular member remembered to enter his/her birthday in the member section's personal info.
		</li>
		<li>
		<b><i>Links: </i></b>
		The links section is simply a listing of various websites posted by members.
		</li>
		<li>
		<b><i>Guestbook: </i></b>
		The guestbook section is an area where only guests can post.
		</li>
		<li>
		<b><i>Message Forum: </i></b>
		The message forum section is most likely going to be your busiest section.  Most GroupLoop message forums 
		have thousands upon thousands of message posts within a year.  Most back and forth conversation takes 
		place in the message forum; its unique organization makes finding, posting, and replying to message posts very 
		convenient.
		</li>
		<li>
		<b><i>Photos: </i></b>
		The photos section is consistently one of our most asked about and popular sections.  The administrator and 
		even members (if you grant them the ability) can add digitized photographs to the photos section in the form 
		of computer image files.  Members also have the ability to add captions to photos.
		</li>
		<li>
		<b><i>Voting: </i></b>
		The voting section holds various multiple choice poll questions that are composed by the administrator or 
		members (if you allow them).  Each voting poll tabulates its results and depicts them on a bar graph.
		</li>
		<li>
		<b><i>Quizzes: </i></b>
		The quiz section is similar to the voting.  However, each quiz has several multiple choice questions each with 
		one correct answer.  After a site-goer takes a quiz, he/she was be told which questions he/she got 
		wrong and the percentage correct.
		</li>
		<li>
		<b><i>Site Stats: </i></b>
		Your site automatically records the number of visits each item (ie. home page, story, quiz, calendar event, etc.) receives.  
		Your site also gives site-goers the ability to rate nearly every type of site item.  The site stats section then 
		calculates and posts tables displaying the most viewed and highest rated items from each section.  In addition, 
		each member has an individual site stats page that contains solely items authored by that member (their own highlights page).
		</li>
		<li>
		<b><i>Section Builder: </i></b>
		Our breakthrough Section Builder allows you to have complete custom control over your site.  Create sections for anything you want - 
		community services, restaurants, movies.  Members can easily add items, or you can be in control.
		</li>
		<li>
		<b><i>Members: </i></b>
		The members section can only be accessed by site members.  This section contains the members menu - a list 
		of links to all special member options.
		</li>
		
	</ul>
