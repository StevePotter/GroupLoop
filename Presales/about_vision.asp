GroupLoop plans on expanding to provide a solution perfect for almost any group.  With our new linked-site system, we 
are able to provide true communities of web sites.  We will continue to work hard to make sites more versatile, powerful, 
and exciting.
</p>

<p>
Along with our Solution Expansion, GroupLoop will also expand our Support Services.  The current average response time 
is about thirty minutes, with no support inquiries unanswered.  We appreciate every customer we have, and will take the 
time and effort to make sure you take advantage of your site's potential.
</p>

<p>
We will also expand our customer base exponentially.  Our customers have repeatedly told us how popular GroupLoop will become.  
Our target marketing strategies are becoming reality, especially with our new <a href="http://www.GroupLoop.com/sales">Continual Commission Program</a>, 
where the rewards of a new sale are shared with everyone.  If you are interested in achieving a new source of income, please
