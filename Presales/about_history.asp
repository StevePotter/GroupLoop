<p>
GroupLoop.com, previously known as potterspages.com, was originally created in January 1997 with two employees.  
Potterspages.com was a Web Design firm, which dealt primarily in interactive web solutions for corporations.  
The founder, President Stephen Potter, realized the need for GroupLoop when designing a page for a group of people to interact.  
After rigorous planning, work was started, and has since grown to hundreds of customers.

Located in Blacksburg, Virginia, the home of Virginia Tech, GroupLoop is the perfect example of an efficient 
dot com startup.  With no outside investment, GroupLoop was able to create an amazing system, keeping our thousands of 
members constantly visiting their sites.  Our system allows the seamless integration of new features, total customization, 
and can even link sites for hierarchical Web Communities.
